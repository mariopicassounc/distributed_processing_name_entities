Text: Obviously Bard is a MASSIVE update for technology moving forward. What ways is Google planning to implement it (other than ads) in Android? Or what ways do you think will be useful?

* Gboard - Will Bard significantly make gBoard way better at voice to text? Or is bard not a language model? because gboard sometimes doesnt translate what I speak correctly. Is this something Bard can improve?

* Google search will obviously be the forefront for general quarries.

* Will it make organizing/creating albums in Google Photos better? "Make an album from the past 5 Halloweens"? stuff like that?

* "When will make packages get here? So it searches my gmail and then tells me locatoin and stuff?

* gboard - create custome pics or gifs? Create a gif of Arnold from the terminator with "text text text" write on it?

Title: Why are GOOD haptic feedback underappreciated in Android??
Publication Date: Wed May 24 17:41:22 ART 2023
Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/13qx2cw/why_are_good_haptic_feedback_underappreciated_in/
Text: Yes, why are haptic feedback so underappreciated in the Android space?

I been smartphone user since 2008, the haptic was never really something that struck my mind much as a "priority" having dabbled with Windows Phones a lot and Android devices such as Galaxy S2 and Xperia Z in the early days, I was generally impressed with iPhones feel of use but was too ignorant to understand why, I knew the vibration motors had something to do with it, but at the time, the idea of haptic was an alien concept. 

Then I had pleasure of owning a Xiaomi Mi 10 Ultra, this device changed my mind, everything I did felt mechanical and had weight to button presses, thats how good the haptic were, it was only when I parted with it duo its long list of software issues that made me tired of it, and going back to Samsung such as Galaxy S20 FE and then S21 Ultra and S22 Ultra through my job, it made me realise how Godawful the haptic were on these devices.

How can Samsung sell you a 1200 euro device that has haptic feedback from 2009? With the iPhone 13 my mother have, I had a spin on it made me realise how much Xiaomi had optimised their Android ROM MIUI to include as much haptic feedback as possible in every place they felt it needed, such as controlling the volume gives a satisfying rattle that grows stronger or weaker depending how low or high it goes, the Xiaomi also had different haptic for back button and home button, even haptic for the fingerprint reader.

iPhone is similar, it has haptic for nearly everything now, it honestly felt extremely satisfying to use despite my absolute disgust for iOS. 

My friend has a LG V60 and its amazing in haptic just like Xiaomi, LG did outstanding work incorporating haptic into everything, a lot of people say Google Pixel phones have good haptic having tried the Pixel 7 in the store, I cannot say I am impressed it felt just like the Sony Xperia 1 I had once upon a time that I actually ended up returning, the haptic are too strong and only present in certain places. Essentially its just the basic Android haptic, there no haptic for volume control as an example.

Let me put it like this, you typing on a keyboard on Xiaomi / LG, you can literally feel the distances from each key, the haptic are different depending where you press on the keyboard, iPhone has similarly if you use a keyboard that supports haptic like Microsoft Swift.

Haptic feedback changes how "good" it feels to use a device if you will, it feels more mechanical, is it going to improve your workflow? Probably not, but it will make the device feel better to use, so why, why is it such an underappreciated feature? 

I only come across 3 devices that implements custom haptic everywhere in Android, LG V60, Xiaomi flagships like Mi 10 Ultra, Mi 11 Ultra and Mi 13 Pro, unfamiliar with Huawei but some people say it does indeed have similar haptic to Xiaomi?
